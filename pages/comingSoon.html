		Welcome to the future home of Classmate Finder!
	</h1>
	<h2 style="text-align: center">Releasing Spring 2022</h2>
	<br />
	<h3>What is Classmate Finder?</h3>
	<p>
		Classmate Finder is a tool to help you find and reach out to your classmates
		before classes start. Fill out your classes, invite all your friends to do
		the same, and then use this to find everyone who shares a class with you!
	</p>
	<br />
	<h3>How will it work?</h3>
	<p>
		Once it's ready, you will be able to create an account and add some contact
		information, then fill out a web form with a list of all the classes you
		will be taking in the upcoming semester.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you have filled out the form, you'll be able to view everyone in your
		classes, alongside their contact info so you can get together before classes
		start.
	</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Why do I want to use this?</h3>
	<p>
		If you have a group of friends and you want to know what classes you have in
		common, then instead of everyone sharing screenshots of their schedules and
		going through everyone else's screenshots to look for shared classes,
		everyone can just fill this out and have the work be done for them!
	</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Are there any integrations?</h3>
	<p>Potential integrations that may be added include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Email notifications when someone new is in your class</li>
		<li>Discord bot to fill out information and get notifications</li>
		<li>Maybe similar bots on other platforms if there is demand</li>
		<li>
			For University at Buffalo students only - potential integration with hUB
			to automatically import data
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				This depends on there being an API that I can use for this and I don't
				know if that exists. I have to look into that
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<h3>What's next?</h3>
	<p>
		Some potential features that won't be included in the initial release, but
		may come later include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adding past classes you've taken so you can advise future students</li>
		<li>
			Listing yourself as willing to be a mentor for students needing help in a
			class
		</li>
	</ul>
