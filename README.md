A tool to help you find and reach out to your classmates before classes start.

## Usage

This program has not yet been generalized for public use. Please wait until
version 1.1.0, when I plan to make this more useable for the general public.

## Installation

I cannot currently reccommend that you duplicate this for your own use.
Please wait until version 1.1.0, when I plan to make the process much easier.
