# Classmate Finder

A tool to help you find and reach out to your classmates before classes start.
Fill out your classes, invite all your friends to do the same, and then use this
to find everyone who shares a class with you!

Initially slated for a Fall 2021 launch, I encountered a significant problem
that I couldn't overcome.
Instead, I've decided to scrap the initial version and move on to what would
have been the version 2.0.0 overhaul.
This will release targeting the Spring 2022 semester.
If you want to see the original source, look at the
[0.1.0](https://github.com/WeirdAlex03/Classmate-Finder/releases/tag/0.1.0) release.
